Statement:
SSDsim is a simulation tool of SSD¡¯s internal hardware and software behavior. It provides specified SSD¡¯s performance, endurance and energy consumption information based on a configurable parameter file and different workloads (trace file).
SSDsim was created by Yang Hu in the end of 2009 and upgraded to version 2.0 after lots of modification and perfection. Its programming language is C and development environment is Microsoft Visual Studio 2008. With the help of Zhiming Zhu, Shuangwu Zhang, Chao Ren, Hao Luo, it is further developed into version 2.x. As the development team, we will continue adding new modules and functions to guarantee its persistent perfection. If you have any questions, suggestions or requirements about it, please feel free to email Yang Hu (yanghu@foxmail.com). We will adopt any reasonable requirements to make SSDsim better.

Application steps:
1)	Compile the code and generate an executablefile.
	A make clean
	B make all
	C, ./ssd
2)	Run the executable file, input the name of trace file 
3)	Analyze the output file and statistic file for further experiments.

Note:
1)	Each request of the trace file possesses one line. A request should be ASCII and follow the format: request arriving time(int64), logical device number (int), logical sector number (int), request size (int), access operator (int, 1 for read, 0 for write). 
2)	The unit of the request arriving time is nanosecond and the unit of the request size is sector (512 Bytes).
3)	No CRLF at the end of the last request line.
